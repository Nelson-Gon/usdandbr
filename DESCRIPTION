Description: Access to nutritional data is key to tackling the growing nutritional problems worldwide. From the 
             increasing rates of diabetes, to the alarming levels of malnutrition in many countries,
             the importance of access to nutritional data cannot be overemphasised. The goal is to therefore provide nutritional researchers with an easy to use
             interface to the USDA Nutrient Data Base.
