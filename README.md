Access and retrieve data from the USDA Nutrient Data Base.

**Version: 0.1.0**

The goal is to provide easy access to the USDA NDB data. This is in the hopes that this would aid researchers looking to study the effects of different feeding behavior on an individual's life and/or aid education of the masses on the importance of proper nutrition. It is also hoped that the package will aid ease of access to USDA NDB data which will in the end provide
a convenient way to analyse our food.
